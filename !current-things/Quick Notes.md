###### **SOLID** - basic principles for object oriented programming

**S - Single Responsibility** - only one reason to modify class
**O - Open/Closed** - open for extensions, closed for modifications
**L -  Liskov Substitution** - functions using references to base classes need to be able to use derived ones as well (polymorphism)
**I - Interface Segregation** - many deidacted interfaces are better than one general one
**D - Dependency Inversion** - high-level modules should not depend on low-level ones; dependencies should be based on abstractions

###### OOP cornerstones

**Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphysm, Encapsulation**


###### Jetpack Compose

ViewPager, SwipeRefreshLayout, RecyclerView, CardView, Material3
Navigation (Graph), Lifecycle, ViewModel


###### Architectural practices

Single Activity Architecture, Gitflow, ViewModel, LiveData, Navigation, ViewBinding


###### FRP - Funtional Reactive Programming
ReactiveX - Rx (RxJava, RxKotlin, etc.)

###### Testing approaches

TDD - Test-Driven-Development - writing tests before production code (smth like Extreme Programming); writing test for it to fail write minimum production code to pass, refactor and test until the code looks good
BDD - Behavior-Driven-Development - behavior of the system is described in a specification using human-readable format using a language (Gherkin); these sepcifications are the basis for writing automated tests


###### Design Patterns

**1. Creational**
Factory Method - 
Abstract Factory - 
Builder - 
Prototype - 
Singleton - 

**2. Structural**
Adapter - 
Bridge - 
Composite - 
Decorator - 
Facade - 
Flyweight - 
Proxy - 

**3. Behavioral**
chain of responsibility - 
command - 
**iterator -** 
mediator - 
memento - 
**observer -** 
state - 
strategy -
