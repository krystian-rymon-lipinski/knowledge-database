**Programming language based on [[031 Programowanie obiektowe|object-oriented]] and [[032 Programowanie funkcyjne|functional]] programming paradigms.**
Its code can be compiled (amongst other things) to bytecode for [[JVM]].


> [!NOTE] Quick Notes
> - everything is an object in Kotlin - all variables/values are references! (basic types are treated more like primitives though)
> - practically everything in Kotlin is an expression that can be assigned to a variable (if-else, when, try-catch, throw, etc.)
> - objects are initialized as non-null by default; nullable type objects need to be explicitly declared
> - Kotlin does not have checked exceptions, catching exceptions is not enforced on the code
