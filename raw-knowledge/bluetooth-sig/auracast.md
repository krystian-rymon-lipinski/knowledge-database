The primary promoted use case for Auracast™ broadcast audio is for it to become a high-quality, lower-cost augmented and assistive listening technology in venues where a public address (PA) or hearing loop infrastructure is currently deployed. Thanks to the connectionless broadcast capabilities of LE Audio, unlimited numbers of users will be able to effectively tune into various audio streams using their own devices within public venues

Somewhat of a subsegment of the public space use cases, Auracast™ broadcast audio has the potential to be leveraged as a multi-language technology in locations that support simultaneous translation services. Users will be able to tune into a relevant stream that can provide information and audio in their preferred language. Typical use cases for this would include conference centers or cinemas.

... and other use cases

> [!NOTE] Why does it need LE Audio though?
> Why not transmit this trough classic Bluetooth? Is it because this technology works only in one-to-one connection and the devices do not have the ability to be broadcasters?
> 
> That seems about right, because the only communication Classic Bluetooth provides is point-to-point, whereas BLE also has the posibility of broadcasting and mesh networking.
