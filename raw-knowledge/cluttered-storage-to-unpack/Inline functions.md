It's worth noting that the `inline` modifier is a hint to the compiler, and the decision of whether to actually inline the function is ultimately made by the compiler itself. In certain cases, the compiler may choose not to inline the function, for example, if the function is too large or if it's called from too many places.

Inline functions can be a powerful tool for improving performance in Kotlin, but it's important to use them judiciously. Inlining large functions or functions with complex control flow can lead to increased code size and potentially reduce the benefits of inlining. It's recommended to use inline functions selectively and consider the trade-offs in each specific use case.
