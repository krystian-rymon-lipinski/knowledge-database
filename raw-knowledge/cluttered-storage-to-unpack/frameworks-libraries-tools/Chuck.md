Chuck is an HTTP inspector for Android that allows you to dig into your application’s HTTP history on your mobile phone. The HTTP log is displayed as a notification, which you can expand to open full Chuck UI. When you use Chuck, your quality assurance team will applaud you as they will be able to see whether an issue persists on Android or the backend side. This library is also sometimes more useful than logcat. That’s because your HTTP history persists even if the app is killed, while logcat sometimes cleans itself after the app is restarted.
