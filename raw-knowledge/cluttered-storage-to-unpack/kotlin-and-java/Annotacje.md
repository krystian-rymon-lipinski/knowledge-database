Annotacje. Po coś chyba są.
Wylistować.

Annotation Processor - 

---

Form of metadata, provide data about a program that is not part of the program itself. Annotations have no direct effect on the operation of the code they annotate.

For example: @Override annotation makes the compiler look for the same method in parent classes and implemented interfaces. It it doesn't find one, compilation error is thrown.

@Deprecated informs, that a particular method is obsolete and should not be used. Compilator will throw a warning otherwise.

@NonNull i @Nullable - W polach klas czy w konstruktorze? A może tu i tu?
